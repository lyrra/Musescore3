====================================================================
      MuseScore Version 3 design goals/changes
====================================================================

- Optimize horizontal layout by allowing overlapping segments.
      - Compute an outline (Shape) for every Staff/Segment.
      - Use the outline to compute the minimum distance between Segments.
            - this also avoids collisions between Lyrics and ChordNames

- Automatically increase vertical space between staves to avoid collisions.
      - Use the segment shapes to compute the minimum distance between staves.

- Do not allow more than one System on a line. In 2.x a horizontal box splits
  a line into two systems. In 3.x a horizontal box is handled as a special measure.
  This simplifies page layout a lot.

- System bar lines are moved into measures in a special segment type "BeginBarLine".

- Do not undo/redo add/removal of "created" elements.
      - It speeds up doLayout() and consumes less memory.

      ? layout of parts after change in one part not necessary

      - incomplete layouts should be possible (layout only up to first page
        to speed up program start)

      In 2.x all Segments must be on the undo/redo stack to keep the history
      consistent, This was necessary as Segments were referring to
      previous/next segments to find the proper insertion point.

      In 3.x  Undo knows were to (re-)insert Segments by only checking type and tick
      position.

- remove pre 2.0 compatibility

      Programming Style Changes in MuseScore 3
====================================================================

      * Instead of
            if (e->type() == Element::Type::Chord)
                  ...
        write
            if (e->isChord())
                  ...

        This is shorter and easier to read. Similar
            if ((s.segmentType() == Segment::Type::ChordRest))
                  ...
        can be written as
            if (s.isChordRestType())
                  ...

      * Use safer type conversion: instead of
            Chord* chord = static_cast<Chord*>(e);

        write
            Chord* chord = toChord(e);

        This adds an Q_ASSERT to make sure e is really a Chord().

      * Prefer vector container over list:
            - Instead of QList use QVector or even better std::vector if possible.

      * Prefer stl style over Qt style when using container:
            - use list.push_back(xx) instead of list.append(xx) or
            - use list.empty() instead of list.isEmpty()
            - etc.

      (see https://marcmutz.wordpress.com/effective-qt/containers/)

      * In iterating a SegmentList instead of
            for (Segment* s = segments->first(); s; s = s->next())
                  ...

        you can write
            for (Segment& s : segments)
                  ...

      * enums
        Some scoped enums can be replaced by classes. Example:

            class Direction {
                  ...
               public:
                  enum _Direction { AUTO, UP, DOWN };
                  ...
                  };

        Goal is to allow
            - allow type conversion (to QVariant for example)
            - add conversion to/from string for use in Xml::read(...)/Xml::write(xxx)


====================================================================
      Known Issues
====================================================================

      * tablature not tested, has likely regressions
      * some scripting interface functions are commented out
      * horizontal layout mode not working
      * disabled relayout for beamed notes
